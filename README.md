# Distributed Kalman filtering under partially heterogeneous models (source code)

Source code for the simulation experiments of the master's thesis [**Distributed Kalman filtering under partially heterogeneous models (2021)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maiquang/maithanh-thesis-src/master/DP_Mai_Thanh_Quang_2021.pdf?token=AD3LNOAMRLND3IYDXSE3Z23BTK3OI) by Thanh Quang Mai.

## Abstract
This thesis explores the problem of distributed Kalman filtering under par-
tially heterogeneous models. A modification to the existing diffusion Kalman
filter is proposed, enabling the employment of partially heterogeneous mod-
els in the diffusion networks. The performance of the less complex models is
futher improved by the implementation of a node failure detection heuristic,
resetting the failling nodes, and giving them a chance at a recovery.
